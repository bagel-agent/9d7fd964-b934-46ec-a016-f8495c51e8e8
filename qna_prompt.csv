Describe how attachment changes and develops from childhood through adolescence.,"""How does attachment change from childhood to adolescence?""  ","Childhood and adolescence allow the development of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.\n\nAge, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining. For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.\n\nIdeally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increase. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual [coregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coregulation) of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.\n\nThe attachment system used by adolescents is seen as a ""safety regulating system"" whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include the presence of potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and/or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility, the behavioural system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescence, we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media. Felt security can be achieved in a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allow adolescent teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescents teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioural maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress.","Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

"List the four adult attachment styles and what infant classifications they roughly correspond to.

### Input: 
""What attachment styles are there in adults?""

### Response:
Attachment theory was extended to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.

Explain the biological and physiological aspects of attachment and how early experiences impact later health.","""What are the biological explanations of attachment?""","The quality of caregiving received in infancy and childhood directly affects an individual's neurological systems which control stress regulation. In psychophysiological research on attachment, the two main areas studied have been [autonomic responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system), such as heart rate or respiration, and the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis), a system that is responsible for the body's reaction to [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology). Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament and the extent to which attachment acts as a moderator. Recent studies convey that early attachment relationships become molecularly instilled into the being, thus affecting later immune system functioning. Empirical evidence communicates that early negative experiences produce pro-inflammatory phenotype cells in the immune system, which is directly related to cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and certain types of cancer.\n\nRecent improvements involving methods of research have enabled researchers to further investigate the neural correlates of attachment in humans. These advances include identifying key brain structures, neural circuits, neurotransmitter systems, and neuropeptides, and how they are involved in attachment system functioning and can indicate more about a certain individual, even predict their behaviour. There is initial evidence that caregiving and attachment involve both unique and overlapping brain regions. Another issue is the role of inherited genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example, one type of [polymorphism](/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology) of the gene coding for the [D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D2) [dopamine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor) has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the [5-HT2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor) [serotonin receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_receptor) with avoidant attachment.\n\nStudies show that attachment in adulthood is simultaneously related to biomarkers of immunity. For example, individuals with an avoidance attachment style produce higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) when reacting to an interpersonal stressor, while individuals representing an anxious attachment style tend to have elevated cortisol production and lower numbers of T cells. Although children vary genetically and each individual requires different attachment relationships, there is consistent evidence that maternal warmth during infancy and childhood creates a safe haven for individuals resulting in superior immune system functioning.

""What is securely attached in adults?""

### Response:
Securely attached adults have been ""linked to a high need for achievement and a low fear of failure (Elliot & Reis, 2003)"". They will positively approach a task with the goal of mastering it and have an appetite for exploration in achievement settings (Elliot & Reis, 2003). Research shows that securely attached adults have a ""low level of personal distress and high levels of concern for others"". Due to their high rates of [self-efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy), securely attached adults typically do not hesitate to remove a person having a negative impact on problematic situations they are facing. This calm response is representative of the securely attached adult's emotionally regulated response to threats that many studies have supported in the face of diverse situations. Adult secure attachment comes from an individual's early connection with their caregiver(s), genes and romantic experiences.\n\nWithin romantic relationships, a securely attached adult will appear in the following ways: excellent conflict resolution, mentally flexible, effective communicators, avoidance of manipulation, comfortable with closeness without fearfulness of being enmeshed, quickly forgiving, viewing sex and emotional intimacy as one, believing they can positively impact their relationship, and caring for their partner in the way they want to be cared for. In summation, they are great partners who treat their spouses very well, as they are not afraid to give positive and ask for their needs to be met. Securely attached adults believe that there are ""many potential partners that would be responsive to their needs"", and if they come across an individual who is not meeting their needs, they will typically lose interest very quickly. In a study comparing secure-secure and secure-various attachment style relationships, there was no fluctuation in positive relational functioning. However, in any combination of two partners with attachment styles outside of security, the relationships showed high levels of negative relationship functioning. This research indicates that it only takes one securely attached partner within a romantic relationship to maintain healthy, emotional relationship functioning.\n\nSexually, securely attached individuals are less likely to be involved in one-night stands or sexual activity outside of the primary relationship, and more likely to report mutual initiation and enjoyment of sex.

Relationally, insecure individuals tend to be partnered with insecure individuals, and secure individuals with secure individuals. Insecure relationships tend to be enduring but less emotionally satisfying compared to the relationship(s) of two securely attached individuals.\n\nAttachment styles are activated from the first date onwards and impact relationship dynamics and how a relationship ends. Secure attachment has been shown to allow for better conflict resolution in a relationship and for one's ability to exit an unsatisfying relationship compared to other attachment types. Secure individuals' authentic high self-esteem and positive view of others allow for this as they are confident that they will find another relationship. Secure attachment has also been shown to allow for the successful processing of relational losses (e.g. death, rejection, infidelity, abandonment etc.) The attachment has also been shown to impact caregiving behaviour in relationships (Shaver & Cassidy, 2018).

### Input:
""How is attachment related to offenses?""","Since early childhood relationships can influence interpersonal relationships throughout the lifespan, attachment theory has been applied in research into particular crimes, particularly those which tend to occur within close relational ties.\n\nDisrupted attachment patterns from childhood have been identified as a risk factor for domestic violence. These disruptions in childhood can prevent the formation of a secure attachment relationship, and in turn, adversely affect a healthy way to deal with stress. In adulthood, a lack of coping mechanisms can result in intense conflict resulting in violent behaviour. Bowlby's theory of functional anger states that children signal to their caregiver that their attachment needs are not being met by the use of angry behaviour. This has been extended to theorize why domestic violence occurs; an adult with consistent experience of insecure attachment may use physical violence to express their attachment needs not being met by their partners. This perception of low support from partners has been identified as a strong predictor of male violence. Other predictors have been named as a perceived deficiency in maternal love in childhood, and low self-esteem. It has also been found that individuals with a dismissive attachment style, often seen in an antisocial/narcissistic-narcissistic subtype of the offender, tend to be emotionally abusive as well as violent. Individuals in the borderline/emotionally dependent subtype have traits that originate from insecure attachment in childhood and tend to have high levels of anger.\n\nIt has been found that sexual offenders have significantly less secure maternal and paternal attachments compared with non-offenders which suggests that insecure attachments in infancy persist into adulthood. In a recent study, 57% of sexual offenders were found to be of a preoccupied attachment style. There is also evidence that suggests subtypes of sexual crime can have different attachment styles. Dismissive individuals tend to be hostile towards others, and are more likely to offend violently against adult women.

When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed showing behaviours such as crying or screaming. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger or helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.\n\nResearch done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999) found that children with abusive childhood experiences were more likely to develop ambivalent attachments.
